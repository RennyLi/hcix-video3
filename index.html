            <h1>Welcome to the Memory Study</h1>
            <p>
                In this study, you will explore how AI-generated content can assist with memory retention. 
                Your task is to focus on several key points presented in bullet form, and we'll provide an AI-assisted 
                pipeline to help you better retain this information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is not to memorize each word exactly but to understand and remember the core ideas. After 
                reviewing the material, you will move on to a questionnaire where we will assess how well you remember the content.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the following page, you’ll begin reviewing the material. The session will be timed, and after the timer ends, 
                you’ll proceed to a page with additional AI-generated cues (videos and images) designed to reinforce your memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you're ready, click "Next" to begin. Focus on understanding the main ideas, and let our AI-generated 
                content guide you through the memory process.
            </p>
            <p>Good luck, and enjoy the journey!</p>
